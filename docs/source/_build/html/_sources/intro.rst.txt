Welcome to projectname!
=======================
Projectname is tool set developed by scientists at Stanford to help automate photocatalysis experiments. Projectname is capable of connecting to hardware, coordinating instruments to run a variety of different experimental procedures, and organizing and analyzing data collected by the system. The project is designed in a modular format to enable users to bring their own unique hardware while still utilizing the core features of experiment management and data handling. The program functions in both a scripted version and a GUI to aid users in planning experimental procedures and manually controlling hardware.

To date, Projectname is compatible with :ref:`Alicat mass flow controllers <alicat_doc>`, heater systems controlled by :ref:`Watlow <harrick_doc>` components, Measurement Computing data acquisition boards (used for communication with :ref:`ThorLabs laser diode drivers <thorlabs_diode_doc>`), :ref:`NewPort 843-R power meter <newport_meter_doc>`, and :ref:`SRI gas chromatographs <sri_gc_doc>`. Support for additional hardware is planned for the future, including FTIR data collection and analysis and NKT Photonics lasers. We strongly encourage interested users to consider :doc:`contributing to the project <developer_guide>` by adding new device support and helping expand the Projectname functionality.

*What else can it do?*

including temperature, laser power, flow rate, and composition sweeps

Installation instructions:
==========================
At this stage of the project, you will very likely need to make edits to the source modules of the package. The current expectation is that each user utilizes the package as a starting point for developing their own automated system. This includes both adding new instrument classes and editting the GUI and experiment control files.
As such, you should install the package in an editable configuration. Before doing so, we **strongly** encourage you to create a new virtual environment specifically for projectname.

.. caution:: 
    This package relies on PyQt which has a different package name when using pip or conda for installation. We try to automatically detect and handle conflicts, but please be aware that its possible to overwrite one with the other if installing in an existing virtual environment. Avoid this by using a fresh environment!

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/Dionne-Lab/photoreactor.git
    cd photoreactor
    pip install -e .  # install in editable mode. 

Motivation
**********

It's annoying to do all this yourself.

Limitations
***********

Absolutely none.
