Introduction
------------
Catalight is tool set developed by scientists at Stanford to help automate photocatalysis experiments. catalight is capable of connecting to hardware, coordinating instruments to run a variety of different experimental procedures, and organizing and analyzing data collected by the system. The project is designed in a modular format to enable users to bring their own unique hardware while still utilizing the core features of experiment management and data handling. The program functions in both a scripted version and a GUI to aid users in planning experimental procedures and manually controlling hardware.

To date, catalight is compatible with :ref:`Alicat mass flow controllers <alicat_doc>`, heater systems controlled by :ref:`Watlow <harrick_doc>` components, Measurement Computing data acquisition boards (used for communication with :ref:`ThorLabs laser diode drivers <thorlabs_diode_doc>`), :ref:`NewPort 843-R power meter <newport_meter_doc>`, and :ref:`SRI gas chromatographs <sri_gc_doc>`. Support for additional hardware is planned for the future, including FTIR data collection and analysis and NKT Photonics lasers. We strongly encourage interested users to consider :doc:`contributing to the project <developer_guide>` by adding new device support and helping expand the catalight functionality.
